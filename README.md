# Restaurant-website
In this restaurant website project, my expertise in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 was pivotal in developing an interactive and visually appealing user interface. These technologies formed the foundation of the website's frontend, ensuring that users had a smooth and engaging experience while browsing through the menu, making reservations, and placing orders.

# Key Features 
i) Used semantic HTML5 elements like <\header>, <\nav>, <\section>, and <\footer> to structure the website, ensuring that the content was logically organized and accessible for search engines and users.
<br>
ii) Employed CSS3 media queries to make the website fully responsive, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
<br>
iii) Used JavaScript to implement an interactive reservation system that ensures built-in validation for user inputs, such as dates and email addresses.
<br>
iv) Minified CSS and JavaScript files to ensure faster load times, enhancing website performance, especially on mobile devices.
